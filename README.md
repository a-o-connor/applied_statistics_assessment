## Introduction 
This repository contains my work on the assessment problems for *Applied Statistics*, a module I am taking as part of the Higher Diploma in Computer Science and Data Analytics at [Atlantic Technological University](https://www.atu.ie/).

The solutions to the problem set are contained in a single [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/a-o-connor/applied_statistics_assessment/blob/main/problems.ipynb). Some roughwork and notes made throughout the semester while studying applied statistics are contained in he `roughwork`folder.

The problem set is available [on Git Hub](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/applied-statistics/blob/main/assessment/problems.md).

## Getting Started
### Dependencies
A number of statistics modules are used throughout the notebook for data manipulation, visualisation and analysis. Links to the documentation for these modules are listed below: 
    - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html) 
    - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
    - [SciPy](https://scipy.org/)
    - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
    - [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) 
    - [Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
\

- The required Python dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.
- Install dependencies using:
    ````bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ````
- The Jupyter notebook can be opened and executed directly, or opened in Google Colab by clicking on the link below:
